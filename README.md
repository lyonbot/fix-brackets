## Extension Settings

## Known Issues

- The bracket matching algorithm is not perfect, so it might not work in some cases (eg. some JSX and HTML case)

- The completing algorithm is based on **indent**, I hope you have a decent code formatting.

- The parser is language-irrelative, so it doesn't complete `,` or `;` for you.
